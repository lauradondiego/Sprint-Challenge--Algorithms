#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)0(n) => you are only running one while loop, which makes this 0(n). "a" will always be less than "n"


b)0(n)


c)0(n)

## Exercise II

I would first create a variable called "stories" and set it to "n".
stories = n
I would create an if statement to check if f less than n, then return "not broken" and if f is greater than n, return "broken" and find the highest floor you can drop eggs at where they won't break.
